1. no module named keypoint_pred 
A: move keypoint_pred.py in a python module folder instead of using it as a python package at current executing path, Or
import sys
sys.path.append('/home/dongyi/ur_ws/src/keypointnet_ros/keypointnet_ros/scripts')


2. rosrun in conda environment, cannot import paddle 
A:
1) How to acquire your python path? $ which python $ which python3 $ conda info --env $ conda env list  
2) change shebang #!usr/bin/python3 into yout python executable path 
3) Not validated - to try adding set(Torch_DIR ".local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/share/cmake/Torch") in CMakeList.txt as https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59916182/importerror-no-module-named-torch-in-ros-package
4)  Not validated -to try $ rosrun keypointnet_ros KeypointDetector.py - DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE = /home/dongyi/anaconda3/envs/paddle_env/bin/python
5) export PYTHONPATH=<你的路径>:$PYTHONPATH , https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/104105709

3. What can I wanna test the published topics despite that I didn't code subscriber? 
A: Just use Rviz to visualize the msgs. Or 
> cv2.imshow('image', img) 
> while(cv2.waitKey(30)==27):
> pass

4. feed RGB into the network and cv2.show(BGR)
5. KPImage didn't change - Because detection image topic didn't send image with bounding boxes successfully in real time. 
6. Keypoint pred accuracy - Doesn't work simultaneously set all queuesize of all subscribers and publishersd in KeypointDetetor.py as queuesize=1 

7. redundant keypoints - side and bottom states 抑制最小值，保证四个点; and combine threshold to report error state; manipulate the shoe with higher average keypoint confidence (keypoint*state confidence) at first.
8. As for keypoint-guided manipulation, judging mechanism (by shoe state) and recall the perception. 

top-heel 点跳
bounding boxes 交叉时关键点误差大 
darknet_ros 时间长了，keypointnet_ros 不显示
