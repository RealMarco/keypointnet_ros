1. no module named keypoint_pred 
A: move keypoint_pred.py in a python module folder instead of using it as a python package at current executing path, Or
import sys
sys.path.append('/home/dongyi/ur_ws/src/keypointnet_ros/keypointnet_ros/scripts')


2. rosrun in conda environment, cannot import paddle 
A:
1) How to acquire your python path? $ which python $ which python3 $ conda info --env $ conda env list  
2) change shebang #!usr/bin/python3 into yout python executable path 
3) Not validated - to try adding set(Torch_DIR ".local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/share/cmake/Torch") in CMakeList.txt as https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59916182/importerror-no-module-named-torch-in-ros-package
4)  Not validated -to try $ rosrun keypointnet_ros KeypointDetector.py - DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE = /home/dongyi/anaconda3/envs/paddle_env/bin/python
5) export PYTHONPATH=<your PATH>:$PYTHONPATH , https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/104105709

3. What can I wanna test the published topics despite that I didn't code subscriber? 
A: Just use Rviz to visualize the msgs. Or 
> cv2.imshow('image', img) 
> while(cv2.waitKey(30)==27):
> 	 pass

4. feed RGB into the network and cv2.show(BGR)
5. KPImage didn't change - Because detection image topic didn't send image with bounding boxes successfully in real time. 
6. Keypoint pred accuracy - Doesn't work simultaneously set all queuesize of all subscribers and publishersd in KeypointDetetor.py as queuesize=1 

7. redundant keypoints - side and bottom states 抑制最小值，保证四个点; and combine threshold to report error state; 
7.5 To manipulate the shoe with higher mainpulate point confidence (or average keypoint confidence, or keypoint*state confidence, or state confidence) at first. - as secondary manipulation order decider (e.g., for top+top, side+ side, bottom+bottom)

8. As for keypoint-guided manipulation, judging mechanism (by shoe state) and recall the perception. 

9. Darknet_rosv4 (YOLOv4) could improve the poor performance below 
a) recognize top point as heel keypoint, and heel as top
b) when shoes are placed next to each other, then could not ouput seperate bounding boxes for each shoe, or inaccurate keypoints based on partial overlapped bounding boxes.

10. darknet_ros 时间长了，keypointnet_ros 不显示


11. Bad callback ... tionError batch_size should be a positive integer.
A: To avoid keypoint inference when no shoe was detected. DONE
12  Add degree symbol ° when present the orientation. DONE

13. check if darknet_ros v4 can publish the detection image successfully?  no,
